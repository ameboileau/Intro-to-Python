# Welcome to the Summer 2022 TCC Python Crash Course!

Here you will find weekly exercises to help build your programming skills!

## git_merge file:
Here you will find written instructions on how to fix a git merge error. These instructions may not work for 100% of cases, so feel free to use Google whenever you get stuck!

## PPT Folder:
Here you will find all PowerPoint lectures. Feel free to consult them whenever you need a refresher!

  - Week 1: Installing Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Git. Forking a git repository onto our own computer. Description of Python objects. Hello World and the print statement.
  - Weeks 2-3: Pulling/pushing using git. Python error codes. Lists and booleans. For loops, while loops, and if statements.
  - Week 4: Functions and packages (numpy)
  - Week 5: Review
  - Week 6: pandas and DataFrame objects, file import/export
  - Week 9: Visual Studio Code, the enumerate function, try-and-except blocks, testing your code

## Exercises Folder:
Here you will find exercises. Download them and try them on your computer!

  - Week 1: Using the print statement. Simple mathematical operations. Combining different objects in a print statement.
  - Weeks 2-3: Debugging simple code, practicing list indexing, for loops, while loops and if statements. Collatz conjecture, Fibonacci sequence, greatest common factor, and the first n prime numbers.
  - Week 4: Calculating the weight of an object, calculating the fixed monthly payment on a mortgage, calculating Canadian federal taxes. Calculating the Gaussian distribution of an array of numbers, calculating some useful statistics, calculating the velocity of an object using conservation of energy.
  - Week 5: Calculating probabilities related to dice tossing, manipulating a phone book, calculating the partial sums of convergent/divergent series.
  - Week 6: Creating and editing a DataFrame of songs, a DataFrame of colours, and a DataFrame of monthly expenses. Loading a book DataFrame from Excel; writing functions to consume the book DataFrame more efficiently. Working with MSF DataFrames and computing certain important quantities.
  - Week 9: Simple functions using VSCode (manipulating strings and lists), practicing the enumerate function on lists, practicing try and except blocks.
  - Final Quiz: A series of 6 questions to put all your skills to the test!
  
## Extra Exercises:
Here you will find extra exercises which should be shorter and easier than the ones found in the Exercises folder

  - basics: strings, float, integers. The print statement.
  - if_statements_and_booleans: If statements and Booleans
  - loops: For loops and while loops
  - functions: Writing and reading/understanding Python functions

## Challenges:
Here you will find especially challenging exercises that put everything you've learned in practice

  - Challenge 1: Approximating the value of pi using a Monte Carlo method
  - Challenge 2: Visualizing the Central Limit Theorem using numpy and matplotlib
  - Challenge 3: Designing a "guessing game" using Python's built-in input() function
  - Challenge 4: Debugging a "choose your own adventure" game
  - Challenge 5: Obtaining the alphabetical Excel column label for the ith column

## Solutions Folder:
Here you will find my solutions to the weekly exercises as well as the challenges. Keep in mind that there are often many different ways to solve a problem, so your solution may be just as good as mine.
