Here you will find weekly exercises to help build your programming skills!

# PPT Folder:
Here you will find all PowerPoint lectures. Feel free to consult them whenever you need a refresher!

  - Week 1: Installing Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Git. Forking a git repository onto our own computer. Description of Python objects. Hello World and the print statement.
  - Weeks 2-3: Pulling/pushing using git. Python error codes. Lists and booleans. For loops, while loops, and if statements.
  - Week 4: Functions and packages (numpy)
  - Week 5: Review

# Exercises Folder:
Here you will find exercises. Download them and try them on your computer!

  - Week 1: Using the print statement. Simple mathematical operations. Combining different objects in a print statement.
  - Weeks 2-3: Debugging simple code, practicing list indexing, for loops, while loops and if statements. Collatz conjecture, Fibonacci sequence, greatest common factor, and the first n prime numbers.
  - Week 4: Calculating the weight of an object, calculating the fixed monthly payment on a mortgage, calculating Canadian federal taxes. Calculating the Gaussian distribution of an array of numbers, calculating some useful statistics, calculating the velocity of an object using conservation of energy.
  
# Extra Exercises:
Here you will find extra exercises which should be shorter and easier than the ones found in the Exercises folder

- basics: strings, float, integers. The print statement.
- if_statements_and_booleans: If statements and Booleans
- loops: For loops and while loops

# Challenges:
Here you will find especially challenging exercises that put everything you've learned in practice

- Challenge 1: Approximating the value of pi using a Monte Carlo method
- Challenge 2: Visualizing the Central Limit Theorem using numpy and matplotlib
- Challenge 3: Designing a "guessing game" using Python's built-in input() function
- Challenge 4: Debugging a "choose your own adventure" game

# Solutions Folder:
Here you will find my solutions to the weekly exercises as well as the challenges. Keep in mind that there are often many different ways to solve a problem, so your solution may be just as good as mine.
